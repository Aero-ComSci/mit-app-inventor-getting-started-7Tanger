Designer view: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0fbb801-27c6-4f94-82d3-e0877eb10d59)
Block view: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27f060ce-c50a-41a7-9dd8-62550ff7c459)

Reflection: I think i could have made the designer view part look a bit cooler. Its nice and all but I think I can still work on it. The block part was pretty simple, no comments for that.
